# TeejiSeat: Teeji Seat video concept
By: Rakesh Mosalpuri rakeshpuri.mosalpuri@gmail.com

## Abstract
My thoughts on how the “Teeji Seat” song should be filmed.

## Characters

This story takes place before the videos for any of Kaka’s songs were released.

- Kaka is a singer/writer, who’s famous for his songs but no one knows him by face.
- Girl is a singer, who works at a club. She takes the bus to commute to and from the club with her friend. She's already a fan of Kaka’s voice and writing.
- Club is located on a beach with 2 entrances. One of the entrances opens towards the road and another one opens towards the beach.

## Story

Kaka takes the bus and notices the girl. He starts taking the same bus daily just to see her and also visits the club where she works. Kaka follows her to the club and imagines a life with her. But the girl is unaware of his feelings.

## Location
Three key locations
- Bus: With a TV.
- Club: On a beach, having a stage for artists to perform and a dining area for the audience to sit and enjoy.
- Beach: Where people can sit and talk overnight.

## Screenplay

### Opening shot
The video opens with a bird’s eye view (drone shot) of a road junction that slowly fades into a bus, focusing on the girl sitting on the third seat.

### Bus
There is a TV in the front section of the bus on which the “Temporary Pyaar” song is playing at a party.
The girl is listening to the song.
Kaka is sitting in the back of the bus and notices the girl and starts admiring her. At this point, the song starts playing.
```
Bus Vich Baithi Sajji Teeji Seat Te
Geet Mera Challe Teri Heartbeat Te
```

Camera pans/cuts to the TV showing people enjoying the song while doing cheers and drinking.
```
Mere Geet Utte Ne Sharabi Nachde
Khadki Jande Ne Ni Glass Kach De
```

Girls ask her friend, who's sitting next to her to listen to the music. As she speaks camera focuses on her face.
```
Ho Khadke De Vicho Mainu Saaj Sunn De
Saajan Vicho Kann Teri Awaz Sunn De
Teri Awaaj Vicho Tera Mooh Dikhdae Ni
```

Kaka seeing all this while writing songs on his phone/notebook.
```
Tere Muh Nu Dekh Dekh Kaka Geet Likhdae
```

The camera cuts to a shot with only Kaka sitting on the bus and singing the monologue.
```
Ho Likht Meri De Vich Sift Teri
Sift Teri Te Ae Grift Meri
Teriyan Grift’an Ch Dil Hai Mera
Mere Dil Vich Ik Ghar Hai Tera
```

The camera cuts to the bus as the driver pulls the break and the girl gets out of the bus with her friend.
```
Tere Ghar Kol Aake Bus Rukgi
```

Time-lapse, Kaka taking the same bus/route just following the girl.
```
Samjhi Na Ethe Meri Gall Mukkgi
Jithe Mukki Otho Challugi Repeat Te
Ni Teri Haan – Na Da Fark Ni
Painda Dheeth Te
```

### Another day
Another day, Kaka and the girl are sitting in their regular seats and the song continues.
```
Bus Vich Bethi Sajji Tiji Seat Te
Geet Mera Challe Teri Heartbeat Te
```

The girl gets down at a stop, Kaka also walks down following the girl. The camera cuts to the girl's face as her face is being lightened by the sun. They both get into the club.
```
Dhupp Jadon Tere Chehre Utte Baithdi
Chehra Tera Jaanda Meri Rooh Ch Baithda
Rooh Meri Baithi Tereyan Khyaal’an Ch
Tera Taan Vajood Lgge Khooh Ch Baithda
```

### Dream sequence
Kaka and the girl walk together towards the ocean with their hand in hand.
```
Khooh Cho Bahar Aaja Jaane Meriye
Aaja Daryavan Di Karavan Sair Ni
```

They both walks for some time and sat down at the beach keeping their legs in the water.
```
Daryan Ton Ocean Da Raah Puchh Ke
Gallan Kar Beach Te Dubo Ke Pair Ni
```

The camera shows the waves coming in and starts touching the feet. Both continue to sit there and talk overnight.
Showing the time-lapse of them talking overnight.
```
Pair Tere Chhoon Giyan Lehran Aan Ke
Lehran Vich Sooraj Dubbuga Jaan Ke
Dubbde Ton Chadh-De Tahi Gall Krange
Gall Uljhake Aape Hall Karange
```

Kaka comes out of the dream sequence.

### Club
The girl is on the stage singing songs and the audience is requesting songs.
Audience requests for “Temporary Pyaar”. The girl agrees to sing the song.
```
Hall Hoyi Gall Te Charha Dayi Phool Ni
```

She starts singing the song.
```
Mere Likhe Geetan Nu Chhuha Dayi Bull Ni
```

Kaka is seeing her sing his song and admires her smile and eyes while having snacks (meat) and drinks.
```
Tere Bull’an Te Smile Jiyu Masala Meat Te
Ni Tere Naina Vicho 2 Peg Laune Neat De
```
### Final shot
The girl finishes her performance, comes and sits next to Kaka. She’s having no idea that he’s the one who has written the song which she just sang.
Kaka gets awestruck and the video fades out.

```
Naal Mere Behji Ohdon Khabbi Seat Te
Ohdo Vi Chaluga Geet Heartbeat Te
```
